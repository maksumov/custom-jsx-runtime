# You don't need React to use JSX

This repository is a hands-on work on the materials of the article [You don't need React to use JSX](https://medium.com/@adostes/you-dont-need-react-to-use-jsx-b78dd2a95c27).

The main conclusion from the article is that thanks to the new JSX Transform mechanism, the size of React-based application dependencies can be reduced to less than 1 Ðšb.
